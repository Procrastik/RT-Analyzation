# RT-Analyzation
Roguetech Tools

This is a personal project to create my own tools for analyzation of files for the Hare Brained Studios Battletech game mod RogueTech.

The first tool is a weapon spreadsheetizer that pulls all weapons and pertinent data for them in the entire mod directory into a spreadsheet for comparisons.
This tool also does JSON and Unicode verification.
